# üßÆ Physics Computational Projects

This repository contains three HTML reports submitted for **PHYS 210: Introduction to Computational Physics** at UBC. Each project explores a different physical system using **numerical simulation** in **Python**, rendered from **Jupyter Notebook** to static HTML.

## üìÅ Projects and Reports

### 1. [**Project 1: Egg Break Threshold in a Rotating Box**](https://tbui06.github.io/physics-projects/project%201.html)

Simulates the motion of an egg sliding inside a 2D rotating wooden box. The goal is to find the **maximum angular velocity** (œâ) at which the box can rotate without the egg breaking. The simulation includes fictitious forces (Coriolis, centrifugal, and friction) in a non-inertial reference frame, and uses elastic collision models to calculate force on the egg.

**Key Outputs**:
- Critical angular velocity at egg break
- Force vs œâ graph
- Trajectory comparisons (broken vs safe)

### 2. [**Project 2: Electron Orbit Stability in a Two-Proton System**](https://tbui06.github.io/physics-projects/project%202.html)

This project analyzes how an electron behaves in a 2D electric field generated by two stationary protons. By scanning different initial positions and vertical velocities, the simulation determines which conditions yield **stable (bound)** or **unstable (unbound)** motion.

**Techniques**:
- Coulomb force model
- Numerical integration with `solve_ivp`
- Energy-based stability check (E ‚â§ 0 ‚Üí stable)

### 3. [**Project 3: Critical Volume of Impure ¬≤¬≥‚ÅµU for a Self-Sustaining Nuclear Chain Reaction**](https://tbui06.github.io/physics-projects/project03.html)

Simulates a 3D fission chain reaction in a cube of impure ¬≤¬≥‚ÅµU. The simulation models random motion, scattering, and fission of neutrons to find the cube volume that results in a **stable third generation** of neutrons (i.e. k ‚âà 1). Monte Carlo methods and spatially dependent fission probabilities are used.

**Findings**:
- Critical volume: **~0.0393 m¬≥**
- k-factor analysis across volumes
- Code validation by neutron distribution

## ‚öôÔ∏è Notes

- All simulations were built with **Python** using:
  - `numpy`, `scipy`, `matplotlib`, `random`
  - `solve_ivp` for ODE solving (Project 2)
- Reports are in **static HTML format** ‚Äî no live widgets or code.
- **Only the reports are included** in this repository, not the raw `.ipynb` notebooks or Python files.
- Simulation methods are described in each report ‚Äî you may reproduce them independently.
