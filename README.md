# Physics Computational Projects

This repository contains three HTML reports submitted for **PHYS 210: Introduction to Computational Physics** at UBC. Each project explores physical systems using numerical simulation techniques and is rendered from Jupyter Notebook to static HTML.

## 📁 Projects and Reports

1. [Project 1: Breaking Point of an Object](https://tbui06.github.io/physics-projects/project%201.html)  
   Analyzes the structural failure point of a falling object using kinematic equations and force balance.

2. [Project 2: Multi-Body System Simulation](https://tbui06.github.io/physics-projects/project%202.html)  
   Simulates interactions in a multi-body gravitational system using Euler and Runge-Kutta methods.

3. [Project 3: Oscillating System](https://tbui06.github.io/physics-projects/project03.html)  
   Investigates a driven damped harmonic oscillator and examines resonance behavior through time-evolution plots.

## ⚙️ Notes

- Reports are static HTML exports — interactive widgets (if any) won’t function.
- Source code (Python, Jupyter) is not included in this version, only final reports.
