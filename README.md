# 🧮 Physics Computational Projects

This repository contains simulation reports submitted for **PHYS 410: Computational Physics** and **PHYS 210: Introduction to Computational Physics** at UBC.  
Each project explores a different physical system using **numerical methods** — PHYS 410 in MATLAB, PHYS 210 in Python/Jupyter — with reports exported to HTML or PDF.

## 📁 Projects and Reports

### 1. **Project 4 (PHYS 410): Galaxy Collisions with the Toomre Model**

Two interacting galaxies are modeled as **massive cores** surrounded by **non-gravitating stars**.
A **second-order finite-difference (Δt²)** scheme advances positions and velocities;  
the model is validated with a **three-level convergence test**.

### 2. [**Project 1: Egg Break Threshold in a Rotating Box**](https://tbui06.github.io/physics-projects/project%201.html)

Simulates the motion of an egg sliding inside a 2-D rotating wooden box to find the **maximum angular velocity** (ω) at which the box can rotate without the egg breaking.  
The simulation includes fictitious forces (Coriolis, centrifugal, and friction) in a non-inertial frame and uses elastic-collision models to compute the impact force.

**Key Outputs**:
- Critical angular velocity at break
- Force vs ω graph
- Trajectory comparisons (broken vs safe)

### 3. [**Project 2: Electron Orbit Stability in a Two-Proton System**](https://tbui06.github.io/physics-projects/project%202.html)

Analyzes how an electron behaves in a 2-D electric field generated by two stationary protons.  
By scanning different initial positions and vertical velocities, the simulation determines which conditions yield **stable (bound)** or **unstable (unbound)** motion.

**Techniques**:
- Coulomb-force model
- Numerical integration with `solve_ivp`
- Energy-based stability check (E ≤ 0 → stable)

### 4. [**Project 3: Critical Volume of Impure ²³⁵U for a Self-Sustaining Chain Reaction**](https://tbui06.github.io/physics-projects/project03.html)

Simulates a 3-D fission chain reaction in a cube of impure ²³⁵U to find the volume producing a **stable third generation** of neutrons (k ≈ 1).  
Monte Carlo methods and spatially dependent fission probabilities are used.

**Findings**:
- Critical volume ≈ 0.0393 m³  
- k-factor analysis across volumes  
- Validation via neutron distribution
